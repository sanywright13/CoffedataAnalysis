### This repository contains my work on data analysis :
coffeeAnalysis.xlsx : is an Excel workbook for analyzing coffee sales data. The analysis includes data from three tables: orders, customers, and products. Through data transformation techniques, including merging tables with Power Pivot and using VLOOKUP functions, the analysis aims to provide insights into sales trends, customer loyalty, and seasonal variations.
#### Features

Data Transformation: Merged tables using Power Pivot to incorporate customer and product information into the orders table.

Customer Loyalty: Utilized VLOOKUP to extract customer loyalty information from the customer table.

Seasonal Analysis: Computed a new column for seasons based on dates and unit sales of products.

Pivot Tables: Generated pivot tables to display sales data for the years 2019, 2020, and 2021.

Slicers: Implemented slicers to filter sales based on product size, enhancing data visualization and analysis.

Timeline Slicer: Incorporated a timeline slicer to visualize sales trends over specific periods.
